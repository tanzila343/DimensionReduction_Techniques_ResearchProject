# Study on Dimension Reduction Techniques

Without sacrificing any of the important characteristics of the original data, a highdimensional dataset may be reduced in dimension using the dimensionality 
reduction approach. In machine learning, when we have high-dimensional data with 
numerous features or variables, it can pose a common problem known as the curse 
of dimensionality. This problem occurs when the amount of features in the model 
grows while its efficiency begins to degrade. The model becomes more 
sophisticated which makes it more difficult to come up with a workable answer. 
Furthermore, overfittingâ€”a situation in which the model fits its initial data closely 
but finds it difficult to extrapolate to new data can result from adding numerous 
characteristics. To tackle these challenges, dimensionality reduction procedures are 
carried out as part of the data pre-processing stage before training the algorithm.
## Overview

Main area of interest in this research is linear and non-linear 
dimension reduction methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

## Technologies Used

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, essential for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used for data preprocessing, analysis, and manipulation, offering data structures like DataFrames that simplify data handling.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A versatile machine learning library providing a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more, along with tools for model selection and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, essential for data visualization and result analysis.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration, providing a centralized repository for project files and code.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Employed for interactive development and experimentation with data and models.


## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a sufficient amount of Bengali text data from social media platforms, ensuring it is annotated with labels indicating instances of cyberbullying.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, digits, and applying stemming to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
3.**Experimental Result**: Scatter plot that visualize with and without dimension reduciton techniques.
By following these steps and leveraging the mentioned technologies, we aimed to develop an effective study on Dimension Reduction Techniques
